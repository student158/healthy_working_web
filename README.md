# Healthy working (Web app)

You can try the app here: https://app-healthyworking.netlify.app/. There is also a desktop version of the app (https://github.com/student158/healthyWorkingDesktop).

Motivation
---------
Sitting too much is [bad for your health](https://mayocl.in/3p0takQ) and developers often sit too much. I made this web app to notify myself to stand up and exercise when I code or study. I hope this app can help others too.

This app uses webcam to detect user sitting. It uses [face-api.js](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html) for face detection.

There is also a desktop version of this app (Windows). The source code for the desktop app can be found [here](https://github.com/student158/healthyWorkingDesktop).
